Multithreading in a data storage engine

In this project a C-based storage engine was provided, and the objective was to implement the multithreading functionality for the 'put' and 'get' commands offered by this storage engine. The implementation needed to enable concurrent execution of these commands by multiple threads. The storage engine was required to execute simultaneous operations accurately and maintain performance statistics. This project involved developing the solution in the C programming language and utilizing the Linux Pthreads library for multithreading support.
